# rpm-packages

A repository for all the RPM .spec files that I maintain (primarily on Fedora COPR).

Most packages are automatically updated by a [script](/update.sh) that fetches the latest versions from [Anitya](https://release-monitoring.org/) and the GitHub API every 12 hours.

If anything is wrong with the packages, please [create an issue](https://github.com/ErrorNoInternet/rpm-packages/issues/new) (or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/ErrorNoInternet/rpm-packages/compare)).
